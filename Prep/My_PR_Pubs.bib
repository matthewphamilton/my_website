abstract="BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common, lifelong inflammatory skin disease, the severity  of which can range from limited disease involving a small body surface area to  extensive skin involvement. It is associated with high levels of physical and  psychosocial disability and a range of comorbidities, including cardiovascular  disease, and it is currently incurable. OBJECTIVES: To (1) confirm which patients  with psoriasis are at highest risk of developing additional long-term conditions and  identify service use and costs to patient, (2) apply knowledge about risk of  comorbid disease to the development of targeted screening services to reduce risk of  further disease, (3) learn how patients with psoriasis cope with their condition and  about their views of service provision, (4) identify the barriers to provision of  best care for patients with psoriasis and (5) develop patient self-management  resources and staff training packages to improve the lives of people with psoriasis.  DESIGN: Mixed methods including two systematic reviews, one population cohort study,  one primary care screening study, one discrete choice study, four qualitative  studies and three mixed-methodology studies. SETTING: Primary care, secondary care  and online surveys. PARTICIPANTS: People with psoriasis and health-care  professionals who manage patients with psoriasis. RESULTS: Prevalence rates for  psoriasis vary by geographical location. Incidence in the UK was estimated to be  between 1.30{\%} and 2.60{\%}. Knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of therapies is  limited because high-quality clinical comparisons of interventions have not been  done or involve short-term follow-up. After adjusting for known cardiovascular risk  factors, psoriasis (including severe forms) was not found to be an independent risk  factor for major cardiovascular events; however, co-occurrence of inflammatory  arthritis was a risk factor. Traditional risk factors were high in patients with  psoriasis. Large numbers of patients with suboptimal management of known risk  factors were found by screening patients in primary care. Risk information was  seldom discussed with patients as part of screening consultations, meaning that a  traditional screening approach may not be effective in reducing comorbidities  associated with psoriasis. Gaps in training of health-care practitioners to manage  psoriasis effectively were identified, including knowledge about risk factors for  comorbidities and methods of facilitating behavioural change. Theory-based,  high-design-quality patient materials broadened patient understanding of psoriasis  and self-management. A 1-day training course based on motivational interviewing  principles was effective in increasing practitioner knowledge and changing  consultation styles. The primary economic analysis indicated a high level of  uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis indicated some situations when the interventions  may be cost-effective. The interventions need to be assessed for long-term  (cost-)effectiveness. LIMITATIONS: The duration of patient follow-up in the study of  cardiovascular disease was relatively short; as a result, future studies with longer  follow-up are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the nature of the psoriasis  and its impact, knowledge of best practice and guideline use are all limited in  those most likely to provide care for the majority of patients. Patients and  practitioners are likely to benefit from the provision of appropriate support and/or  training that broadens understanding of psoriasis as a complex condition and  incorporates support for appropriate health behaviour change. Both interventions  were feasible and acceptable to patients and practitioners. Cost-effectiveness  remains to be explored. FUTURE WORK: Patient support materials have been created for  patients and NHS providers. A 1-day training programme with training materials for  dermatologists, specialist nurses and primary care practitioners has been designed.  Spin-off research projects include a national study of responses to psoriasis  therapy and a global study of the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis. A new  clinical service is being developed locally based on the key findings of the  Identification and Management of Psoriasis Associated ComorbidiTy (IMPACT)  programme. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health  Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research programme and will be  published in full in Programme Grants for Applied Research; Vol. 10, No. 3. See the  NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.",

Forest models were used to assess predictive ability of six candidate measures of psychological distress, depression and anxiety and linear / generalised linear mixed effect models were used to construct longitudinal predictive models for AQoL-6D change.Results A depression measure (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was the strongest independent predictor of health utility. Linear regression models with complementary log-log transformation of utility score were the best performing models. Between-person associations were slightly larger than within-person associations for most of the predictors.Conclusions Adolescent AQoL-6D utility can be derived from a range of psychological distress, depression and anxiety measures. TTU algorithms estimated from cross-sectional data can approximate longitudinal change but may slightly bias QALY predictions.Toolkits The TTU models produced by this study can be searched, retrieved and applied to new data to generate QALY predictions with the Youth Outcomes to Health Utility (youthu) R package - https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC, APP1076940), Orygen and headspace.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was reviewed and granted approval by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee, and the local Human Ethics and Advisory Group (1645367.1).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: headspace centres provide enhanced primary mental healthcare for young  people. A priority is to provide services for all young people irrespective of a  range of social disadvantages or social exclusion. The aims of this study were to:  (i) delineate extent of social inclusion across domains of housing,  studying/employment, functioning, alcohol, and other drug use; and (ii) map profiles  of young people deemed vulnerable to experiencing additional barriers to accessing  services based on their social inclusion domains (e.g., those living in unstable  housing, not in employment/education, and/or experiencing intersecting or multiple  forms of disadvantage or difficulties), including detailing their clinical  characteristics. METHODS: Young people were recruited from five headspace centres.  Data relevant to social inclusion were examined. Multivariate logistic regression  models were used to determine overlap between vulnerable groups, functional, social,  clinical, and behavioural factors. RESULTS: 1107 young people participated, aged  12-25 years (M{\thinspace}={\thinspace}18.1 years, SD{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3.3), most living in stable housing (96.5{\%}) and  engaged in studying/employment (84.8{\%}). Specific vulnerabilities were evident in  young people with NEET status (15.2{\%}); in unstable accommodation (3.5{\%}); of  culturally diverse backgrounds (CALD) (12.2{\%}); living in regional areas (36.1{\%}); and  identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning, and  asexual plus (LGBTIQA+; 28.2{\%}). Higher levels of distress, substance use, functional  impairment, and lower social support were reported by those who were NEET and/or in  unstable housing. LGBTIQA+ status was associated with high distress, depressive  symptoms, and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants reported good social  support, stable housing, and engagement in work or education. Those deemed  vulnerable were likely to experience social exclusion across multiple domains and  reported more mental health problems. The co-occurrence of mental ill-health and  social exclusion highlights the importance of integrated mental healthcare.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim People diagnosed with mental disorders experience higher rates of unemployment than those without. Career adaptability, defined as the ability to respond flexibly and make informed career decisions in work and throughout career transitions, is becoming increasingly important as the nature of work changes rapidly. Early vocational intervention may ameliorate poor education and employment outcomes experienced by young people with mental ill-health and promote transferable skills and adaptability. Online-based career support allows for ongoing access throughout different career stages. The current study combines mental health-informed digital career and peer motivation, to create a Youth Online Training and Employment System (YOTES) that supports young people with mental ill-health obtain and remain in education or employment. Methods This study is an unblinded randomized controlled trial for young people with mental ill-health, aged 16–25, who are seeking vocational support. Participants will be randomized to receive either YOTES, a moderated, online intervention with vocational, social, and peer motivation, or a control intervention, the headspace Digital Work and Study Service. Both groups will have access to in-person career support if seeking employment. The primary outcome will be career adaptability compared between the YOTES and control groups at 6-months post baseline. Secondary outcomes include number of hours worked in the past 7 days, hope, career confidence, psychological distress and health economic outcomes at 6- and 12-months post baseline. Conclusion Results will demonstrate whether an online career intervention moderated by career practitioners with peer motivation can result in improved career adaptability in young people with mental ill-health.},

The aim was to determine whether the K6 was appropriate for monitoring outcomes in such settings. 1067 young people were recruited from Australian headspace services. We examined dimensionality of the K6, measurement invariance, and how the K6 correlated with the the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9)and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder–7 Scale (GAD-7). Standardised Response Mean (SRM) and Cohen's d effect size (ES) were used to examine 3-month stability of the K6. The best-fitting model was a two-factor model: (i) nervous and restlessness; and (ii) hopeless, worthless, depressed and effort. Measurement non-invariance was observed for sex and age groups. K6 strongly correlated with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The K6 was less sensitive to change compared to these other two measures. There was some support for the K6 being a screener for young people presenting to primary care; however, there issues arise with its use as an outcome measure. These issues include measurement non-invariance, concern about the dimensionality and focus of items, and its sensitivity to change.}

Schools are a logical setting for youth suicide prevention activities, with universal, selective and indicated approaches all demonstrating efficacy. Given that international best practice recommends suicide prevention programs combine these approaches, and that to date this has not been done in school settings, this study aims to evaluate a suicide prevention program incorporating universal, selective and indicated components in schools. &lt;h4&gt;Methods: &lt;/h4&gt; This study is a trial of a multimodal suicide prevention program for young people. The program involves delivering universal psychoeducation (safeTALK) to all students, screening them for suicide risk, and delivering internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Reframe IT) to those students identified as being at high risk for suicide. The program will be trialled in secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia, and target year 10 students (15 and 16 year-olds). safeTALK and screening will be evaluated using a single group pre-test/post-test case series, and Reframe IT will be evaluated in a Randomised Controlled Trial. The primary outcome is change in suicidal ideation; other outcomes include help-seeking behaviour and intentions, and suicide knowledge and stigma. The program’s cost-effectiveness will also be evaluated. &lt;h4&gt;Discussion: &lt;/h4&gt; This study is the first to evaluate a suicide prevention program comprising universal, selective and indicated components in Australian schools. If the program is found to be efficacious and cost-effective, it could be more widely disseminated in schools and may ultimately lead to reduced rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour in school students across the region.},

Method Brief online survey of headspace service providers exploring the number and types of clients seen, confidence in identifying neurocognitive impairments, and need, availability and usefulness of CNA. A total of 532 salaried, private and in-kind service providers working across 103 primary headspace and headspace Youth Early Psychosis Programs completed the survey from May to December 2017. Results Survey respondents were 76% female with a mean age of 38 (range 22-74 years). The majority had psychology (42%) or social work (21%) backgrounds. CNA was believed to be beneficial for 35% of headspace clients on average, but 86% of service providers reported that CNA was unavailable. Only 12% of clients were estimated to have received CNA when it was needed. On average, 36% of headspace clients were estimated to present with neurocognitive impairment and 38% were described as diagnostically complex (e.g., comorbid medical, developmental, substance use, trauma presentations). A mean of 27% were described as having a suspected or diagnosed developmental condition (e.g., intellectual disability, learning disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Respondents rated their confidence in identifying cognitive impairment as moderate. Conclusions There is marked unmet need for CNA to provide diagnostic clarification and inform treatment approaches in youth mental health care. Funding for CNA under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, headspace workforce development in neurocognitive screening and cognitive interventions, and tele-neuropsychological services should be explored.},

The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive compensatory interventions for psychosis by examining the effects on functioning and symptoms, and exploring whether intervention factors, study design, and age influenced effect sizes.Electronic databases (Ovid Medline, PsychINFO) were searched up to October 2018. Records obtained through electronic and manual searches were screened independently by two reviewers according to selection criteria. Data were extracted to calculate estimated effects (Hedge’s g) of treatment on functioning and symptoms at post-intervention and follow-up. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool.Twenty-six studies, from 25 independent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis (1654 particiants, mean age=38.9 years, 64% male). Meta-analysis revealed a medium effect of compensatory interventions on functioning compared to control conditions (Hedge’s g = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.60, P<.001), with evidence of relative durability at follow-up (Hedge’s g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.54, P<.001). Analysis also revealed small significant effects of cognitive compensatory treatment on negative, positive, and general psychiatric symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. Estimated effects did not significantly vary according to treatment factors (ie, compensatory approach, dosage), delivery method (ie, individual/group), age, or risk of bias. Longer treatment length was associated with larger effect sizes for functioning outcomes. No evidence of publication bias was identified.Cognitive compensatory interventions are associated with robust, durable improvements in functioning in people with psychotic illnesses.},

Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach to health-related behaviour change that has been used successfully for patients with long-term conditions. This study assessed change in clinicians’ MI skills and psoriasis knowledge following Psoriasis and Wellbeing (Pso Well®) training. Objectives To investigate whether the Pso Well training intervention improves clinicians’ MI skills and knowledge about psoriasis-related comorbidities and risk factors; and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the Pso Well training content, delivery and evaluation. Methods Clinicians attended the 1-day training programme focused on MI skills development in the context of psoriasis. MI skills were assessed pre- and post-training using the Behaviour Change Counselling Index. Knowledge about psoriasis-related comorbidity and risk factors was assessed with a novel 22-point measure developed for the study. Interviews with clinicians were analysed qualitatively to identify perceptions about the feasibility and acceptability of the training. Results Sixty-one clinicians completed the training (35 dermatology nurses, 23 dermatologists and three primary-care clinicians). Clinicians’ MI skills (P < 0·001) and knowledge (P < 0·001) increased significantly post-training. Clinicians found the training valuable and relevant to psoriasis management. Conclusions Attendance at the Pso Well training resulted in improvements in clinicians’ knowledge and skills to manage psoriasis holistically. Clinicians deemed the training itself and the assessment procedures used both feasible and acceptable. Future research should investigate how this training may influence patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Abstract Aim A growing number of quantitative studies have investigated the utility of neuropsychological assessment in mental health settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has qualitatively explored youth mental health providers' perceptions of neuropsychological assessment services. A more in-depth understanding of the perceived advantages and barriers associated with neuropsychological assessment in youth mental health settings is critical to better inform policy, practice and service uptake. Thus, the aim of this study was to qualitatively explore clinicians' views about neuropsychological assessments for youth with mental health concerns. Methods A single open-ended qualitative question, included as part of an anonymous cross-sectional online survey, was completed by clinicians (N = 206) treating or assessing adolescents and young adults within Australian primary care mental health centres (headspace). Responses were analysed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. Results Five main themes were identified. Clinicians (a) identified barriers to accessing neuropsychological assessments (53%), (b) indicated a range of mixed outcomes following neuropsychological assessment (39%), (c) highlighted a need for neuropsychological assessments (22%), (d) reported a lack of awareness about this resource (10%) and (e) described practice issues associated with neuropsychological services (4%). Conclusion This study uncovered perceived factors contributing to reduced access to neuropsychological assessment in Australian youth mental health settings. Given potential adverse outcomes resulting from this clinical service gap, efforts should be made to address factors contributing to poorer access, thereby mitigating the impact of poor access on the management of mental illness in youth. Several strategies, including funding neuropsychological assessments, are discussed.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have shown that neuropsychological assessment is a scarce resource in youth mental health settings. The need for neuropsychological assessment might differ in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas due to characteristics inherent to these different regions. However, no formal studies have investigated this question. The aim of this research was to investigate whether need for neuropsychological assessment in youth mental health settings varies by geographic location. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by clinicians (N = 532) treating or assessing adolescents and young adults attending Australian primary care mental health (headspace) centers. Results indicated a similar need for neuropsychological assessment across the geographic areas. However, neuropsychological assessment was significantly less available to clients in outer regional, remote and very remote areas compared to major cities. Exploratory analyses further revealed that there were significantly fewer clinicians with a postgraduate degree and more clinicians with a bachelor degree in outer regional, remote and very remote areas than in major cities. Given the negative impact of cognitive impairments in youth with a mental illness, these findings reveal a necessity to enhance the availability and access to neuropsychological assessment in rural settings. Several plausible avenues to achieving increased access include increasing the funding available for this resource; providing nonmetropolitan clinicians with sufficient neuropsychological consultation, including rural training and rotations in neuropsychologists' postgraduate training; and exploring the use of tele-health in the provision of neuropsychological assessments in nonmetropolitan settings.},

The aim of the study was to examine the barriers and enablers for young people accessing the YACs in Gippsland. Methods Using qualitative methodology, nine female YAC staff members and seven youth YAC consumers were interviewed. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify important and consistent themes in the data derived through the consultation process. Results Barriers under four themes were identified: environmental (eg, limited transport); service (ie, limited opening hours); client (eg, parent permission) and staff (ie, retention of staff). Enablers were identified as environmental (ie, high social proximity), service (eg, funding), client (ie, awareness of service) and staff (eg, champion staff). Conclusion The success of new rural service models will likely depend on learning from what has already worked in some of the many small communities in this region. Beyond learning, further success and uptake of new service offerings will be enhanced through understanding community needs, obtaining community support and enhancing high social proximity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Headspace services provide treatment options to young people seeking mental healthcare. To obtain a better understanding of needs and characteristics of this population, and effectively evaluate services, we require novel youth-specific outcome measures. As part of our broad research program to establish such measures, a sample of young people were recruited and assessed. The study describes (i) methodology used to obtain clinical, functioning, and substance use characteristics of young people presenting to headspace services; and (ii) an overview of these characteristics. METHODS: Young people presenting to headspace centres were recruited. Multidimensional information was obtained relating to clinical and functional outcomes, demographic information, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: 1107 young help-seeking individuals were recruited. Participants were most likely young adults aged M = 18.1 years, SD = 3.3, with diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety (76.6%, n = 801), engaged in work and study (84.9%, n= 890), and living with parent(s) (68.9%, n = 736). Impairments in functioning were moderate as indicated by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (M = 65.2, SD = 9.5), substance use was common (alcohol 62.7%, n = 665; illicit substances 30.5%, n = 324), and current suicidal ideation was reported by a third (33.6%, n = 358). CONCLUSIONS: A broad dataset was obtained providing an insight into key clinical, functional and quality of life characteristics of these individuals. We observed that young people present with complex problems, comorbid diagnoses, moderate levels of symptomatology, impairments in functioning, substance use, and suicidal ideation. This work provides the foundation for our broader research program aiming to develop novel, relevant and youth-specific, change and outcome measures.},

   abstract = {The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.},

   abstract = {Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair aims to prevent premature death from AAA rupture. Elective repair is currently recommended when AAA diameter reaches 5.5 cm (men) and 5.0 cm (women). Applying population-based indications may not be appropriate for individual patient decisions, as the optimal indication is likely to differ between patients based on age and comorbidities. Objective To develop an Aneurysm Repair Decision Aid (ARDA) to indicate when elective AAA repair optimises survival for individual patients and to assess the cost-effectiveness and associated uncertainty of elective repair at the aneurysm diameter recommended by the ARDA compared with current practice. Data sources The UK Vascular Governance North West and National Vascular Database provided individual patient data to develop predictive models for perioperative mortality and survival. Data from published literature were used to model AAA growth and risk of rupture. The cost-effectiveness analysis used data from published literature and from local and national databases. Methods A combination of systematic review methods and clinical registries were used to provide data to populate models and inform the structure of the ARDA. Discrete event simulation (DES) was used to model the patient journey from diagnosis to death and synthesised data were used to estimate patient outcomes and costs for elective repair at alternative aneurysm diameters. Eight patient clinical scenarios (vignettes) were used as exemplars. The DES structure was validated by clinical and statistical experts. The economic evaluation estimated costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the NHS, social care provider and patient perspective over a lifetime horizon. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the data and the value for money of ARDA-based decisions. The ARDA outcome measures include perioperative mortality risk, annual risk of rupture, 1-, 5- and 10-year survival, postoperative long-term survival, median life expectancy and predicted time to current threshold for aneurysm repair. The primary economic measure was the ICER using the QALY as the measure of health benefit. Results The analysis demonstrated it is feasible to build and run a complex clinical decision aid using DES. The model results support current guidelines for most vignettes but suggest that earlier repair may be effective in younger, fitter patients and ongoing surveillance may be effective in elderly patients with comorbidities. The model adds information to support decisions for patients with aneurysms outside current indications. The economic evaluation suggests that using the ARDA compared with current guidelines could be cost-effective but there is a high level of uncertainty.Limitations Lack of high-quality long-term data to populate all sections of the model meant that there is high uncertainty about the long-term clinical and economic consequences of repair. Modelling assumptions were necessary and the developed survival models require external validation.Conclusions The ARDA provides detailed information on the potential consequences of AAA repair or a decision not to repair that may be helpful to vascular surgeons and their patients in reaching informed decisions. Further research is required to reduce uncertainty about key data, including reintervention following AAA repair, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of the ARDA for use in routine clinical practice.

   abstract = {Abstract Objective: To identify attributes of youth mental health care for which there is evidence of potential cost-effectiveness. Study design: We performed a literature review of economic evaluations that examined both costs and outcomes for attributes of youth mental health care other than pharmacological or individual psychological therapies for full-threshold disorders. Data sources: We searched the United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database for evaluations published to the end of 2014; and MEDLINE, Google Scholar and the citation lists of relevant publications for peer-reviewed studies published in English since 1997. Data synthesis: Forty economic evaluations met inclusion criteria. Psychosis was the mental disorder with the most developed economic evidence base, with good evidence of cost-effectiveness for first-episode psychosis services. There was a developing cost-effectiveness evidence base for other disorders. The most common attributes of the interventions examined in the included studies were the location of services, engagement and support of families, assessment, prevention, early intervention, group delivery format and information provision. We used our findings to formulate a list of attributes of youth mental health care that may be acceptable to young people and potentially cost-effective. Conclusion: There is at least suggestive cost-effectiveness evidence for a range of attributes of youth mental health care. Further economic research is needed to substantiate most cost-effectiveness findings and to improve targeting of care among young people. Future economic evaluations should examine costs from both societal and health care perspectives and incorporate evidence regarding young people's preferences.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To explore the potential utility of clinical stage and mental disorder categories as a basis for determining which attributes of youth mental health care should be offered to which groups of young people. Methods: In June 2017, we conducted an online survey of youth mental health clinicians that collected information on the participants' background and areas of expertise, then presented vignettes describing young people with different stages of six mental disorders (disorder-based vignettes were matched to participants' area of expertise). For each vignette, participants were asked to give a quantitative estimate of the proportion of young people with similar mental health problems they thought would clinically benefit from each of twelve attributes of mental health care (other than pharmacological or individual psychological therapies). Survey results were analysed as independent, disorder-based samples, using standard statistical tests of significance, and as a stratified sample using mixed-effects models. Results: A total of 412 clinicians working in 32 countries participated in both parts of the survey. Respondents represented a broad range of clinical disciplines, settings and areas of expertise. Their estimated proportions of young people who would benefit from the mental health care attributes varied by clinical stage and disorder (eg, a mean of 93% [interquartile range (IQR), 90%–100%] of young people with Stage 2 psychosis were estimated to benefit from case management with a multidisciplinary team; while only 15% [IQR, 1%–25%] of young people with Stage 1b generalised anxiety disorder were estimated to benefit from collection and processing of biological samples). Neither the background of the respondents nor the sex of the characters in the vignettes significantly influenced the results. Conclusion: A combination of clinical stage and disorder information might be an appropriate basis for ensuring that the right attributes of early intervention mental health care are provided to the right young people at the right time. Policy and research priorities include trialling novel services, preferences research among young people, strengthening service responses to subthreshold disorders and promoting high-fidelity collection of clinical stage data in youth mental health settings.},

   abstract = {Background Psoriasis frequently requires lifetime control and current therapies vary significantly in price. High-quality economic evaluations are necessary to determine if higher-cost treatments are value for money. Objectives This review aims to identify the cost-effectiveness of psoriasis care (whether more expensive interventions are associated with savings in health care and psoriasis management and/or improve patients' health); assess the level of uncertainty and transferability of this evidence to policy and practice; and, identify future research needs. Methods Searches of electronic databases Embase, MEDLINE and NHS EED for full economic evaluations were conducted in January 2012 (updated April 2014). Included articles were screened, selected and critically appraised using predefined inclusion criteria and data extraction forms: 1355 articles were identified; 37 papers reporting 71 comparisons met the inclusion criteria. Treatments evaluated were systemic (n = 45), topical (n = 22), phototherapies (n = 14) and combination (n = 4). Results Despite a significant number of recent economic evaluations, the cost-effectiveness of all therapies remains unclear. This uncertainty arises from a diversity in settings, perspective and design. Economic evaluations were constrained by limited availability of high-quality short- and long-term head-to-head comparisons of the effectiveness, safety and adherence of different interventions. Conclusions The economic evidence is dominated by comparisons of interventions to placebo, with implicit comparisons of different therapies. There is a lack of evaluations of service model innovations to deliver complex packages of care for psoriasis. Primary and secondary integrated clinical and economic research is needed to address the limitations and to identify patient preferences and barriers/facilitators to treatment.},

   abstract = {Mortality from mental illnesses is increasing and, because they frequently occur early in the life cycle, they are the largest source of disability and reduced economic productivity of all non-communicable diseases. Successful mental health reform can reduce the mortality, morbidity, growing welfare costs and losses in economic productivity caused by mental illness. The government has largely adopted the recommendations of the National Mental Health Commission focusing on early intervention and stepwise care and will implement a reform plan that involves devolving commissioning of federally funded mental health services to primary health networks, along with a greater emphasis on e-mental health. Stepwise expanded investment in and structural support (data collection, evaluation, model fidelity, workforce training) for evidence-based care that rectifies high levels of undertreatment are essential for these reforms to succeed. However, the reforms are currently constrained by a cost-containment policy framework that envisages no additional funding. The early intervention reform aim requires financing for the next stage of development of Australia's youth mental health system, rather than redirecting funds from existing evidence-based programs. People with complex, enduring mental disorders need more comprehensive care. In the context of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, there is a risk that these already seriously underserved patients may paradoxically receive a reduction in coverage. E-health has a key role to play at all stages of illness but must be integrated in a complementary way, rather than as a barrier to access. Research and evaluation are the keys to cost-effective, sustainable reform.},

   abstract = {Psoriasis is a common, life-long inflammatory skin condition associated with high levels of physical, psychological and social disability as well as co-morbidities including psoriatic arthritis, the metabolic syndrome, Crohn's disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Psoriasis is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), however the relationship is not yet wholly understood and is confounded by common co-occurrence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as smoking, drinking excess alcohol or being overweight or sedentary. CVD risk information is complex for clinicians to communicate and patients to understand, and supporting risk-reducing strategies in the form of lifestyle behaviour change is challenging, particularly when people are already living with a demanding long-term condition. Additionally, there are indications that patients are dissatisfied with psoriasis care and that treatment approaches may be inadequate. IMPACT is a five-year programme of applied research, funded by NIHR, which aims to improve health services for people with psoriasis. It comprises a multi-disciplinary team of academics, clinicians and patients and draws on a range of research approaches. Phase I of the programme involves four interlocking workstreams, each focused on key questions in psoriasis management. All findings from Phase I have informed the planning and development of a final workstream (Phase II), the Psoriasis and Wellbeing ('Pso Well'<sup>®</sup>) intervention, comprising a practitioner training package and new patient resources to support people living with psoriasis to self-manage in the best ways. This article summarises the key findings of IMPACT Phase I and describes the Phase II next steps.},

Methods Participants were 42 young people (15–25 years) (50% men; mean age = 18.5 years) in partial or full remission. Participants had access to the Rebound platform for at least 12 weeks, including the social networking, peer and clinical moderator and therapy components. Results Follow-up data were available for 39 (92.9%) participants. There was high system usage, with 3034 user logins (mean = 72.2 per user) and 2146 posts (mean = 51.1). Almost 70% of users had ≥10 logins over the 12 weeks, with 78.5% logging in over at least 2 months of the pilot. A total of 32 (84%) participants rated the intervention as helpful. There was significant improvement between the number of participants in full remission at baseline (n = 5; none of whom relapsed) relative to n = 19 at 12-week follow-up (P < 0.001). Six (14.3%) participants relapsed to full threshold symptoms at 12 weeks. There was a significant improvement to interviewer-rated depression scores (Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); P = 0.014, d = 0.45) and a trend for improved strength use (P = 0.088, d = 0.29). The single-group design and 12-week treatment phase preclude a full understanding of the clinical benefits of the Rebound intervention.

    abstract = { Objective The objective of the Entourage project was to develop an innovative digital mental health intervention addressing key barriers experienced by young people in accessing evidence‐based therapy for social anxiety. In particular, Entourage takes a specific focus on reaching young men, given their lower rates of service engagement.Method This article discusses the theoretical underpinnings, therapeutic mechanisms, persuasive technology elements, and development process of a novel approach incorporating graphic medicine, clinical and peer support, and social networking.Results Based on an integrated cognitive model of social anxiety disorder and consistent with the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a novel digital intervention for social anxiety was developed (Entourage). Using the moderated online social therapy (MOST) model, Entourage provides young people with a digital strengths‐based platform to overcome social anxiety symptoms. Designed in close partnership with young people with a lived experience of mental ill‐health, and overseen by a steering group of young men, Entourage applies graphic medicine through bespoke therapy comics to help users understand and overcome symptoms. Program e‐mentors (expert clinicians and trained peer workers) work in tandem to maintain engagement, support participant skill acquisition, and promote opportunities for social connectedness. Behavioural experiments and in‐vivo exposure activities facilitate restructuring of maladaptive social anxiety‐focussed cognitions.Conclusions Entourage represents an innovative approach to managing social anxiety in young people. Intervention elements seek to ensure longer‐term engagement of users, in particular young men, who have unmet service needs. Results of a single‐group clinical trial of Entourage are forthcoming. }

   abstract = {Objective The primary objective was to determine the acceptability, feasibility and safety of a novel digital intervention (Entourage) for young people with prominent social anxiety symptoms, with a particular focus on the engagement of young men. The secondary aim was to explore whether the intervention was associated with clinically significant improvements to clinical and social variables known to co-occur with social anxiety. Method A multidisciplinary team comprising of mental health clinicians, researchers, young adult fiction writers, a comic artist and young people with a lived experience of social anxiety developed the Entourage platform in collaboration. Entourage combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques for social anxiety with an engaging, social-media-based interface that allows users to build social connections, while also receiving expert clinical moderation and support from peer workers. Acceptability, feasibility and safety outcomes of Entourage were tested in a 12-week pilot study with 89 young people (48.3% male; age M = 19.8 years, SD = 3.3 years). Eligible participants were recruited via liaison with four headspace early-intervention centres in north-western Melbourne. Results 56.8% of the sample reported social anxiety symptoms in the severe or very severe range at baseline. Results demonstrated the Entourage intervention was feasible, safe, and potentially acceptable, with 98.6% of participants reporting they would recommend Entourage to another young person experiencing social anxiety. Usage results were also comparable across male and non-male participants. Results showed that young people reliably and significantly improved on clinical and social variables. In particular, young males showed a clinically significant improvement on social anxiety symptoms (d = 0.79, p < .001), depression (d = 0.71, p < .001), belongingness (d = 0.58, p = .001), increased feelings of social connectedness (d = 0.46, p = .004) and decreased loneliness (d = 0.46, p = .006). Non-male participants also experienced a significant increase in social connectedness (d = 0.76, p < .001), alongside reduced social anxiety (d = 0.78, p < .001) and experiential avoidance (d = 0.81, p < .001). Conclusions Entourage is a highly engaging and potentially effective intervention that represents a novel combination of features designed both to reduce social anxiety symptoms and improve social connection among young people. Entourage demonstrated some acceptability, feasibility and safety, with encouraging benefits to clinical and social variables. Entourage also showed favorable results for the engagement and support of young men with social anxiety symptoms.},

   abstract = {AIM: People diagnosed with mental disorders experience higher rates of unemployment than those without. Career adaptability, defined as the ability to respond flexibly and make informed career decisions in work and throughout career transitions, is becoming increasingly important as the nature of work changes rapidly. Early vocational intervention may ameliorate poor education and employment outcomes experienced by young people with mental ill-health and promote transferable skills and adaptability. Online-based career support allows for ongoing access throughout different career stages. The current study combines mental health-informed digital career and peer motivation, to create a Youth Online Training and Employment System (YOTES) that supports young people with mental ill-health obtain and remain in education or employment. METHODS: This study is an unblinded randomized controlled trial for young people with mental ill-health, aged 16-25, who are seeking vocational support. Participants will be randomized to receive either YOTES, a moderated, online intervention with vocational, social, and peer motivation, or a control intervention, the headspace Digital Work and Study Service. Both groups will have access to in-person career support if seeking employment. The primary outcome will be career adaptability compared between the YOTES and control groups at 6-months post baseline. Secondary outcomes include number of hours worked in the past 7 days, hope, career confidence, psychological distress and health economic outcomes at 6- and 12-months post baseline. CONCLUSION: Results will demonstrate whether an online career intervention moderated by career practitioners with peer motivation can result in improved career adaptability in young people with mental ill-health.},
