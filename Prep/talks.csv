"""A workflow for replicable data synthesis and simulation research in mental health""",MP Hamilton,Research Seminar,"""Orygen, Melbourne""",Seminar,2020,,"""false""",,,,,,,,"""A key goal of scientific studies is that they are replicable, i.e. they can be repeated with different data. A step towards this goal is reproducibility, which means enabling other researchers to repeat a study using the same data. In principle, data synthesis and simulation studies have fewer potential barriers to reproducibility and replicability than many experimental designs as they are predominantly performed within scientific computing environments. However, in practice mental health projects of this type frequently have low levels of both reproducibility and replicability. Inadequately reported and inaccessible code and data, sometimes enclosed within restrictive licensing and custodianship arrangements make it hard for other researchers to reproduce simulation studies. Even when these barriers are overcome, the implementation of these projects rarely facilitates generalisation to other source data or decision contexts by abstracting datasets to data-structures and  converting (single-purpose) programs to (multiple-purpose) code libraries. The Health Services and Outcomes Research team at Orygen have sought to address these issues by developing software to comprehensively document, standardise and partially automate a workflow that spans the life-cycle of synthesis and simulation projects from initial ingest of raw data dissemination of results. This presentation outlined the key features of that workflow and demonstrate the novel toolkit we have developed with worked examples using both toy and real project data. Some of the legal, technical, funding and skills issues involved in implementing the workflow were also be discussed.""","""2020-10-16T12:30:00Z""","""Reproducible Research, Simulation"""

Our project has used a mixed methods approach to develop a conceptual model of resilience and an open-source toolkit for developing policymaking decision aids. 
The conceptual model was developed via a combination of literature reviews, stakeholder engagement (public forum, youth working group, youth focus groups and a policy hackathon, interviews with experts) and deliberations by the research team. The conceptual model defined resilience in terms of the extent to which normative developmental trajectories relating to mental health are retained or regained following exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Individual, family and community factors impacting resilience were included in the conceptual model. 
The conceptual model informed the development of a synthetic population of Australian households for use in policy decision aids.  The first step required fusing similar records from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia and the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children databases. In this way, an enriched dataset was created with a range of variables relevant to the resilience concept that were not available in any one dataset. As a an additional step to protect the confidentially of participants in those surveys, a purely synthetic version of that population was then constructed using predictive models estimated from the fused  “seed” database and scaled up to represent the Australian population. 
Code libraries to develop the synthetic agents and to incorporate those agents in simulation based decision aids were developed in R using an object-oriented programming approach. Collectively, these code libraries and the conceptual model they are based on represent a framework for complex systems modelling of resilience. However, better evidence about how ACE status impacts the efficacy of mental health prevention strategies is required before resilience offers practical benefits as a framework of decision making over existing constructs such as mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorder. 
This presentation outlined the development of our conceptual model, the methods in creating our synthetic population of agents and how this aligns with the intervention evidence base and amenability to mathematical modelling.""","""2019-10-16T13:00:00Z""",

"""Readyforwhatsnext: an open source framework for developing simulation models of emerging mental disorder""",MP Hamilton and G Wiesner,Research Seminar,"Orygen, Melbourne",Seminar,2019,,"""false""",,,,,,,,"""Systems level change in mental health is a major and costly undertaking. Getting it right is often difficult  and some bad decisions are hard to rectify. For these reasons, major system innovations should ideally be robustly tested prior to implementation using simulation based approaches. However, mental health is both complex and highly contextual. We are a long way from having a mental health “theory of everything” that describes the systems in which mental disorders emerge and are treated sufficiently well to reliably predict the potential impacts of a wide spectrum of policy and service design choices. Instead we have lots of disparate bits of theory in the form of simulation models, but these are often of limited generalizability beyond the spatiotemporal and decision contexts for which they were developed. Their utility to many decision makers, especially where regional commissioning approaches apply, is often limited. These simulation models can be resource intensive to produce, but the lack of common theoretical and technical frameworks and consistent meta-data descriptions limit the extent to which modellers can efficiently leverage the insights, algorithms and data of their peers. To help address this challenge, we have developed a framework to support open source development of mental health simulation models, along with supporting code libraries and data-packs. In this presentation we described this framework with four examples from work undertaken as part of Orygen’s economics work-stream. These four examples are simulation models of 
-	the epidemiology of mental disorders in young people;
-	resilience in children and young people;
-	decision making of socially anxious young people relating to e-mental health; and
-	primary youth mental health care services.""","""2019-11-01T12:00:00Z""",
"""A framework for modelling the anticipated impact of policy options to promote resilience in children and young people""","""M Hamilton, A Parker, P Plencnerova, G Wiesner, J Karnon and C Mihalopoulos""",Society of Mental Health Research,Melbourne,Oral,2019,,"""false""",,,,,,,,"""Background: Resilience is a popular construct in mental health but its desirability and utility as a framework for resource allocation is unclear. Challenges include the need for differentiation from overlapping concepts such as mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders, identifying an aligned intervention evidence base and amenability to mathematical modelling. 
Methods: A mixed methods approach was employed to develop a conceptual model of resilience and open source tools to support modelling studies. The conceptual model was developed via literature review, public engagement through a public forum, youth engagement through a youth working group, youth focus groups and a policy hackathon, interviews with experts and deliberations by the research team. The conceptual model determined the features included in a quasi-synthetic population of households that we constructed by using bin matching to fuse records from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia and the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children databases. A purely synthetic version of that population was then constructed using predictive models estimated from the fused database. Code libraries were developed in R using an object oriented programming approach.
Results: The conceptual model defined resilience in terms of the extent to which normative developmental trajectories relating to mental health are retained or regained following exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Individual, family and community factors impact resilience, suggesting a complex systems, agent based modelling approach. To support such approaches we produced a synthetic population comprised 42,553 individual agents, described with 122 features. We created 11 code libraries whose functionality supports sampling from and simulation of synthetic agents for multiple spatiotemporal contexts.
Conclusions: Modelling resilience is complex and would benefit from open source collaborations. Our framework may help. However, better evidence about how ACE status impacts the efficacy of mental health prevention strategies is required.""","""2018-11-28T11:00:00Z""",
