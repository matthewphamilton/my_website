Springtides is a model that synthesises geometry and spatial attribute data. Currently the main application of the model has been as a spatial epidemiology model that predicts the prevalence of a range of mental health and substance disorders for user defined regions of Australia. In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Sydney, Springtides was deployed early in the COVID-19 pandemic to [predict potential changes in the prevalence of mental disorders](https://www.orygen.org.au/About/News-And-Events/2020/Modelling-predicts-an-additional-82,000-young-Vict) in the absence of Government intervention. That analysis was reported in media coverage in [May](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/alarm-raised-over-pandemic-linked-mental-health-crisis-20200514-p54t2z.html) and [December](https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/mental-health-of-young-must-be-a-post-virus-priority-20201212-p56mxk.html) 2020.

The Springtides model is currently undergoing substantial redevelopment in preparation for a public release. Some background about the model is provided from about the 55 minute mark of [this webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6g_DzBPOqo).
