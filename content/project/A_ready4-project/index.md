## Purpose
ready4 is an R software framework for transparent, reusable and updatable systems models. It provides a set of tools to support the development of models of [places](/project/b_springtides-project/), [people](/project/c_springtolife-project/), [programs](/project/d_ontarget-project/) and [platforms](/project/e_firstbounce-project/) that can be flexibly combined as modules of overarching [systems models](/project/f_readyforwhatsnext-project/).

## Published output

### Documentation
A [documentation website](https://www.ready4-dev.com/) consolidates multiple online resources to provide an overview of the ready4 framework and examples of the projects to which it is being applied.

### Software

The foundation of the ready4 framework is provided by the [ready4](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/) R package (development version).

The bare-bones framework provided by ready4 can be extended using tools contained in the following development version R packages:

- [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html), [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) and [ready4pack](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4pack/index.html) (for authoring and documenting code libraries of model modules);
- [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/index.html) (for authoring self-documenting programs and reporting templates); and 
- [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/index.html) (for authoring, curating and labelling model datasets).

### Dataset
Taxonomies, abbreviations and other meta-data to help implement the framework are available in [an online repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RIQTKK).
