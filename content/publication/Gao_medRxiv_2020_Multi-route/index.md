abstract: "The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behavior, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provides a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the transmission efficiency of different transmission routes of respiratory diseases and provides a basis for predicting the impact of individual level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks. (Word count: 153)HighlightsA multi-route transmission model is developed by considering evaporation and motion of respiratory droplets with the respiratory jet and consequent exposure of the susceptible.We have illustrated that each transmission route may dominate during the influenza transmission, and the influential factors are revealed.The short-range airborne route and infection caused by direct inhalation of medium droplets are highlighted.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialN/AFunding StatementThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51278440) and the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong{textquoteright}s Collaborative Research Fund (C7025-16G), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the HKU-Zhejiang Institute for Research and Innovation (HKU-ZIRI) Seed Funding Programme.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
