abstract: "**Aim** Approximately 15 years ago, four youth access clinics (YACs) were established in the Gippsland region to improve mental and general healthcare for young people living in the region. The aim of the study was to examine the barriers and enablers for young people accessing the YACs in Gippsland. **Methods** Using qualitative methodology, nine female YAC staff members and seven youth YAC consumers were interviewed. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify important and consistent themes in the data derived through the consultation process. **Results** Barriers under four themes were identified: environmental (eg, limited transport); service (ie, limited opening hours); client (eg, parent permission) and staff (ie, retention of staff). Enablers were identified as environmental (ie, high social proximity), service (eg, funding), client (ie, awareness of service) and staff (eg, champion staff). **Conclusion** The success of new rural service models will likely depend on learning from what has already worked in some of the many small communities in this region. Beyond learning, further success and uptake of new service offerings will be enhanced through understanding community needs, obtaining community support and enhancing high social proximity."
