The establishment of new early psychosis services in six metropolitan centres in Australia creates practical challenges for service planners in projecting service demand over time and optimally configuring staffing profiles. This project aimed to develop an open source toolkit to estimate service demand and assist in service planning. The presentation summarised a literature review of economic studies of early psychosis services and the development of R code libraries and data packs, version controlled through GitHub.  Data packs included spatial data census and population projection data; epidemiological models for treated prevalence derived from metropolitan Melbourne and cost data extracted from the literature review.
