As an economic researcher, my main focus is to help improve the [transparency, reusability and updatability](https://www.ready4-dev.com) of computational models used to inform health policy and system design. 

I believe that complex modelling projects are best approached iteratively and collaboratively. For these reasons, the models I work on adopt open source approaches.
